This course is about learning about what goes behind Automatic Control systems. Automatic COntrol Systems are ubiquitous.

* **Automobiles** - Controllers in cars
* **Industrial** - Power generation: All turbines are heavily controlled
* **Robotics** - Use many control ideas
* **Aerospace** - Heavy use of control sysytems
* **Economics** - Inflation rates and exchange rates

## Automation Examples

1. **Control of Gasoline Engine** - In gasoline engines, when we press accelerator more, we are basically taking more air in. So more air we take, more speed we get. 

Automatic control system decides how much fuel to put in. The control is based on the Air / Fuel ratio. It should be maintained 14.6 and 14.7 to have least amount of emmissions. We don't want too much fuel

So the challenge is to maintain the ratio throughout working life of engines despite varying demands fom driver, changes in behaviour of driver etc.

2. **Motor Commutation Problem** - Motor consists of rotor and stator. Stator has windings. Rotor starts turning because of interaction between magnetic fields. 

Commutation is the process of exciting different windings ( via voltage fluctuations) such as amount of torque supplied keeps the motor running.

So we want the angle between rotor's magnetic field and stator's magnetic field to be kept to a particular value.

Choose Va, Vb, Vc over time such that magnetic flux is regulated.

3. **Electric Power Steering** - Handle wheel is connected to pinion. Idea of power steering is to reduce the amount of effort driver has to put to turn the steering. There is an assisting motor that imposes some torque that along with driver's torque turns the car.

Control problem - Keep the driver torque demand small (not zero) despite varying steering loads seen by the pinion P. 

4. **Watts Flyball Governor** - Rotating machineries like turbines of generators often have to rotate at close to a desired speed or the generator has to produce power at some particular frequencies. This is because devices are made such way.

So is we need to produce power at particular frequency, we need a constant speed for turbines i.e. we need to govern the speeds of turbines.

In watts flyball governor, charge flow is regulated by a valve.

Control problem - Regulate speed of generator shaft to a constant value despite varying loads (Different amounts of machines are used during different times)


5. **Wind Turbine Control** - Too much wind, we want to protect the windmill from disintegrating. Less wind, we want more electricity.

6. **Economics** - 

* **Monetary Policy Committee, Inflation** - control problem is to keep inflation within a certain band using measures such as repo rate, reverse repo rate, CRR. Control is exercised by regulating money supply.

* **Exchange rate fluctuation control** - Control problem is to reduce volatility in FX rate, especially in the presence of disturbances to the economy, by buying or selling dollars.

RBI tends to reduce the fluctuations in exchange rates rather than being interested in the actual exchange rate
