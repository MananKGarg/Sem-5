We'll focus today on turning process. Turning is a material removal process. Hardness of cutting tool should be more than work piece. Metal removal has a lot to do with shear mechanism. 

Cutting tool angle - Initially, reducing alpha would help but as we leep increasing it, strength of cutting tool would be compromised. 

Common cuting tools: High speed steel, WC, Diamond

Conventional Machining Processes - Turning, Drilling, Shaping, Milling

Difference between turning and drilling - Drilling has two cutting edges. Milling cutters have 2,4,6,12 (multiple) cutting edges. 

**Various Machining process (Material Removal Processes)** 

Conventional - Physical contact and the fundamental mechanism is plastic deformation by shear mechanism
Non conventional - Have other mechanism. Like ECM (Electro chemical Machining), uses electrolysis for machining. 

**Conventional Machining** 

1. Single point cutting - Turning, Boring, Shaping, Planing
2. Multi point cutting - Drilling, Milling, Tapping, Reaming, Broaching, Sawing
3. Abrasive - Grinding, Lapping, Homing

Removal of hard surface layers is done by abrasive processes.

**How is machined surface generated**

Cutting motion (Primary motion) - for material removal
Feed motion - to provide new(fresh) surface to machine

Generatrix - Lines generated by the cutting motion of the tool
Directrix - Lines generated by feed motion of tool

by using different kins of generatrix and directrix, we can generate various profiles

Taper turning - Making cone like profile from a cylindrical work piece.
